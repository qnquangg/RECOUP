 *         This node is part of the RPL multicast example. It basically
 *         represents a node that does not join the multicast group
 *         but still knows how to forward multicast packets
 *         The example will work with or without any number of these nodes
 *
 *         Also, performs some sanity checks for the contiki configuration
 *         and generates an error if the conf is bad
